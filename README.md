Course project for CS449

- To demonstrate that reasoning can help to identify perception mistakes by neural networks that violate semantic constraints, which in turn can make perception more robust.

## Getting Started

- To train the model

```
cd digit_detector
python3 model.py -train
```

- Get the Sudoku grid
